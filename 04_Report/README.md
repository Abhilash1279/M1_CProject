 It,s a calendar program which will prints a calendar of our whole year.The purpose if this program is to basically learning of our C language in programming.The calendar program application presented here is a very simple console application  developed using C programming language.It is built without using any graphic properties: instead it utilizes  many windows properties  to give application a colorful  look and feel.It is compiled in code::blocks using GCC compiler.\
 The C programming language provides many standard library functions for file input and output. These functions make up the bulk of the C standard library header <stdio.h>.  #include<stdio.h> is a statement which tells the compiler to insert the contents of stdio at that particular place.The first thing you will notice is the first line of the file, the #include "stdio.h" line. This is very much like the #define the preprocessor , except that instead of a simple substitution, an entire file is read in at this point.The system will find the file named "stdio.h" and read its entire contents in, replacing this statement.\
 We have used these main things:1) Do statement2) For loop3) Function.\
 In C, the "main" function is treated the same as every function, it has a return type (and in some cases accepts inputs via parameters). The only difference is that the main function is "called" by the operating system when the user runs the program. Thus the main function is always the first code executed when a program startsWhen main calls a function, it passes the execution control to that function. The function returns control to main when a return statement is executed or when end of function is reached.In our main function firsly we  declare our variables which we have to use in our function.
